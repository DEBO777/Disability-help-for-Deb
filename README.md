Please help I need someone to help me get approved for disability due to I am disabled and I don't know how to go about it.  I do have two Blue book for SSA, Chronic conditions that are expected to last for life.. I have no income @present I need help with filing for SSI and SSDI if anyone wants to take on the challenge with me. I also need donations if anyone is interested in giving to my cause. Anything would be appreciated. I'd be extremely grateful for any and all help. Thank You Sincerely yours, Deborah Nolan.
